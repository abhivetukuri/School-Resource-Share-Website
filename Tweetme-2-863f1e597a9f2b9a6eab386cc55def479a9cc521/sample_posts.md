1.) https://libgen.is/, is the best resource I've found for school textbooks. It is constantly adding new texts to what is already one of the largest collections on the internet.

2.) Check out project gutenburg, https://www.gutenberg.org/. A free website that has over 60,000 ebooks on a range of topics from classic literature to modern poems. Has pdfs of many of the books used in English classes across the country!

3.) A cool resource I've been using is Google Scholar, https://scholar.google.com/, its a google search engine that contains many free scientific articles, posted by the researchers themselves. Definetly a must use in all my classes.

4.) If anyone is interested in learning a new language and already aren't familiar with duolingo, check it out at https://www.duolingo.com/. This is truly the best and most comprenhensive language learning site I've every used. 100% recommend this as a supplementary resource for anyone learning a language.
